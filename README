 * libfftw3-dev
 * rtl-sdr

== Build Instructions ==

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

You can test the program using the included sample capture:

$ xz -d < ../support/sample.xz | src/nrsc5 -r - 0

== Usage ==

This was designed for use with a rtl-sdr dongle since that was our testing platform.

Options:

  frequency                       rtl-sdr center frequency
                                    (do not provide frequency when reading from file)
  program                         audio program to decode
                                    (0, 1, 2, or 3)
  -d device-index                 rtl-sdr device
  -g gain                         rtl-sdr gain (0.1 dB)
  -p ppm-error                    rtl-sdr ppm error
  -r samples-input                read samples from input file
  -w samples-output               write samples to output file
  -o audio-output                 write audio to output file
  -f adts|wav                     audio format: adts or wav
                                    (adts playback requires modified faad2)

Examples:

$ nrsc5 -p 63 -g 490 -w samples1071 107100000 0

$ nrsc5 -r samples1071 0
